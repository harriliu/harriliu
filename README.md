# 👨‍💻 Data Scientist by Day, Dad Joke Aficionado by Night

```python
def introducing_myself():
    skills = ['Data Science', 'AI', 'Machine Learning', 'Turning Coffee into Code']
    status = 'Wrangling both datasets and toddlers with varying degrees of success'
    current_role = 'Teaching machines to learn while teaching tiny humans to human'
    return "Hello World! Or as my kids would say: 'Daaaad, you're embarrassing me!'"
```

When I'm not training neural networks or explaining why the sky is blue for the 47th time today, you'll find me in the kitchen conducting flavor experiments with the precision of a laboratory scientist. My success rate is higher with algorithms than soufflés, but I persist nonetheless.

## Currently Balancing:
- 📊 Turning messy data into actionable insights
- 🤖 Building AI that doesn't take over the world
- 👨‍👧‍👦 Raising the next generation of curious minds
- 🍳 Perfecting the ultimate pancake recipe (version 2.9.7 - almost there!)

## My Commit History:
- Debugging code: ████████████ 60%
- Debugging life: ████████ 40%
- Dad jokes that land successfully: █ 5%

> "In our house, we don't say 'I love you' - we say 'I cleaned your dataset and normalized all the variables' which means the same thing."

🔍 Looking to collaborate on projects that make the world better for the next generation!
